# ðŸ”¬ Organization of the `spec.sh` file:
#
# (1) spec.loadConfigs - this searches for spec.config.sh
#                        files and sources them, allowing
#                        for complete customization of
#                        any and all `spec.sh` functionality
#
# (2) spec.main - this is only executed when `spec.sh` is
#                 called directly from the command-line
#
# (3) spec.runFile - this is executed safely in a subshell
#                    once for every file that is passed to
#                    `spec.sh` from the command-line
#
# (5) Spec Runner API - the functions that make up the rest
#                       of this file are considered the
#                       "Spec Runner API" and include all
#                       of the necessary code for loading
#                       spec files and executing them
#
# (5) bundled dependencies - when `spec-full.sh` is used all
#                            of the integrated libraries are
#                            included at the end of this file
