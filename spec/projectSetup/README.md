# `spec` / `projectSetup`

These are the first specs written to test-drive the creation of `specs` `v6`.

These specs ensure that these things work OK from the get-go:

- Can compile multiple separate files into a single `specs()` function with subcommands
- Can generate new API documentation for each command and subcommand as well as arbitrary pages
